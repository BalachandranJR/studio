- Background color: Very light blue (#EBF4FA), a desaturated shade of the primary, for a clean and airy feel. Convert to HSL hue 206, saturation 30% and lightness 95%.
- Accent color: A vibrant yellow (#F4D03F), analogous to blue, to highlight interactive elements and calls to action. Convert to HSL hue 51, saturation 85% and lightness 57%.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for a blend of modern look and warmth. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clear, recognizable icons to represent different aspects of the itinerary (activities, transport, food, etc.).
- Maintain a clean and well-organized layout to ensure ease of navigation and readability.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance the user experience (e.g., loading screens, expanding details).
